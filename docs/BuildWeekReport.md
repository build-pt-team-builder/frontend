# Build Week Report: TeamBuilder App (Thursday)
by [Wilfred Morgan](https://github.com/wmemorgan)

- [Thursday App](https://teambuilderapp.netlify.com/main/projects)

- [Project Repository](https://github.com/build-pt-team-builder/frontend/tree/wilfred-morgan)

## Summary
The project objective was to build an app that would allow for better management of Build Week projects.

My role as a Front-end Architect was to build the front-end portion of the app which included UI elements and business logic. I teamed up with another Front-End Architect to build the app from scratch. We divded the tasks amongst ourselves. 

### Project Tasks
- [Project Assignments](https://trello.com/b/Ln4ERWP2/team-builder-pt?menu=filter&filter=member:wilfredmorgan4)
- [Code contributions](https://github.com/build-pt-team-builder/frontend/commits?author=wmemorgan)

All project objectives and milestones from the front-end team were achieved in a timely manner. 

### Stretch Tasks
In addition to doing front-end development I also assumed the role of project coordinator and created, organized, and updated the project backlog.

We had a two person front-end team so I assumed the role of lead developer and established git protocols, pull request code reviews and merges, and pair programming bug fixes.

Due to unforseen circumstances our Back-end Architect did not provider her deliverables as promised so I staged a demo API server which allowed the Front-end team to complete and test action creators, reducers, and API calls. Information about the stand-in API can be found [here](https://github.com/wmemorgan/teambuilder-backend/blob/master/README.md).

### Project Materials
I created the following planning materials to facilitate product development:
- [TeamBuilder Front-end Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w9PZrYNrKt_kToLpL4l25JCi_RnC3Mvgpv3qXUoPjXk/edit#gid=0)
- [Data Model](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5ccb9c86f7c5bb70c72fd86f)

## Retrospective (Individual)

#### What happened
- Achieved MVP and reached milestones in a timely manner
- Able to get app functional without a proper backend
- Staged a mock backend to provide testing platform for API calls

#### What did I learn
- How to do code reviews
- How to manage pull requests and merge conflicts on Github
- How to break down a programming project into smaller parts and divide them amongst ourselves

#### What did I do well
- Managed project backlog
- Review pull requests and manage branch merges into the main trunk
- Provide technical/software development support

#### What should I have done better
- Getting stronger consensus with the other front-end developer and Web UI team about the look, feel, and layout of the app
- Devote more time with Web UI team to provide deeper feedback and code review of their deliverables
- Devote more time to creating mockups or wireframes of the app
- Create and execute an project risk plan to account for contigencies if key milestones were not achieved

## Retrospective (Build Week Program)
Right from the start our project had the following challenges:
- Lack of guided direction on how to initiate the project
- Rogue Web UI team member using arcane technology not taught in the curriculumn
- Absentee Back-end developer that was uncommunicative
- Inexperienced project team leader
- Conflict in the Front-end team about product design
- Varied levels of technical skills
- Lack of software development protocols and coding style guidance

In spite of (and because of) all those challenges this was hands down one of the **BEST EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES** for learning about the world of professional software development. 

In just two weeks I got hands on experience in:
- Agile project planning and management
- Product architecture and design development
- Source control management
- Review and troubleshooting another developer's code
- Technical team leadership
- Conflict management
- Managing project roadblocks
- Learning a new technology in under 24 hours
- Working under a deadline in a group project
- Working with ambiguity

These experiences serve as a small glimpse into what professional software development teams face every day. All the victories and defeats we faced is something every development team experiences at some point in their careers. I have a better understanding of why software development teams have to be so selective with hiring new developers (especially inexperienced ones).

My biggest takeaway is being able to use this experience to focus my learning (technical and soft skills) on becoming a `net contributing` software development team member.

#### What went well
- Simulating a challenging (but very possible) working environment (by far the biggest benefit)
- Having access to tools (diagramming, mockup, deployment) that aided with project execution and can be used in future projects and throughou my career
- Regular meetings with our regular PM and access to support resources

#### What could be better
- Bring UX designers on the team
- More training and guidance for students on how to initiate a project (architecture and design planning)
- More training for project team leads and PMs on real world project management principles (Agile and Waterfall methodology)
- Having a Build Week tool that everyone can access. I submit our project as consideration for the basis of an internal tool:
