# Build Week Report: TeamBuilder App (Thursday)
by Wilfred Morgan

- [Thursday App](https://teambuilderapp.netlify.com/main/projects)

- [Project Repository](https://github.com/build-pt-team-builder/frontend/tree/wilfred-morgan)

## Summary
The project objective was to build an app that would allow for better management of Build Week projects.

My role as a Front-end Architect was to build the front-end portion of the app which included UI elements and business logic. I teamed up with another Front-End Architect to build the app from scratch. We divded the tasks amongst ourselves. 

A list of my tasks can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/Ln4ERWP2/team-builder-pt?menu=filter&filter=member:wilfredmorgan4). All project objectives and milestones from the front-end team were achieved in a timely manner. 

In addition to doing front-end development I also assumed the role of project coordinator and created, organized, and updated the project backlog.

Due to unforseen circumstances our Back-end Architect did not participate in the project so I staged a demo API server which allowed the Front-end team to complete and test action creators, reducers, and API calls. Information about the stand-in API can be found [here](https://github.com/wmemorgan/teambuilder-backend/blob/master/README.md).

### Project Materials
I created the following planning materials to facilitate product development:
